A User-Friendly Computational Workflow for High-Throughput Protein Design: Integrating RFD, MPNN, and AlphaFold
Designing de novo protein binders is a critical area of interest in modern protein engineering, often requiring manual oversight and validation. Our user-friendly pipeline integrates RFdiffusion (RFD), ProteinMPNN (MPNN), and AlphaFold (AF) into a streamlined framework, enabling the automated generation of highly tunable, application-specific binders. Central to this pipeline is its tunable design, allowing users to optimize parameters for specific research needs, and a novel algorithmic sorter that evaluates candidate binders using structural metrics such as predicted Local Distance Difference Test (pLDDT) scores and Root Mean Square Deviation (RMSD).The pipelineâ€™s versatility is demonstrated across multiple applications, including the design of Flu A20 binders, Vav1/GEFH1 inhibitors, and COVID-19 epitope scaffolds. By automating traditionally time-consuming steps and incorporating robust quality assessment, this pipeline addresses critical bottlenecks in protein binder design. Its ability to scale and adapt to diverse applications offers an accessible and efficient tool throughout the protein engineering landscape.
